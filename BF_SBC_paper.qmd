## Theoretical background

BF and BMA

Calibration of BF as prediction calibration

This requires simulations (we do not know real-world ground truth and don't belive our models too much either)

DAP vs SBC

SBC for BF (BF to prob to ranks)

SBC for BF as prediction calibration

Testing the full BMA model

Data-dependent quantities (those require full SBC)

## Toy examples

### Single binary observation

- DAP does not recognize some failures
-

### Pois vs. negbinom

- DAP is slow to find problems
- SBC allows detecting posterior = prior


## Real examples

### Schad et al.

Are BMA quantities useful?

### Something where bridgesampling works
